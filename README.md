# 🎮 A Simulator for Biology Invasion Studies (EcoHack 2025 - Team BioSim)

## 📚 About
BioSim is an **LLM-based multi-agent framework** designed to simulate biological invasions. This framework helps researchers model and analyze the impact of invasive species on native ecosystems using adaptive AI-driven agents. Our system integrates **large language models (LLMs)** with ecological modeling to provide a scalable, flexible, and data-driven simulation approach.

### 💡 Key Features
- **LLM-Driven Reasoning**: Agents make decisions dynamically based on environmental data and predefined ecological principles.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Models the interactions between invasive and native species through adaptive simulation.
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Incorporates structured input data and literature-based ecological models.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides simulation insights through charts and graphical outputs.
- **Scalability & Adaptability**: Can simulate different invasion scenarios across diverse ecosystems.

## 📦 Installation
To install and run BioSim, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Georgelingzj/ecohack-2025.git
cd ecohack-2025

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file and add the following environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
OPENAI_API_URL = "https://api.openai.com"
```

## 📝 Usage
Run the simulation with the following command:

```sh
python gradio_demo.py
```
