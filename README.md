# EcoHack 2025: Ecological Invasion Simulation System

## Overview

This project models ecosystem dynamics in real-time, simulating interactions among native, invasive, and endangered species. By combining cellular automata, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), and environmental parameter modeling, it provides an interactive platform for understanding species invasion and ecological balance.

## Key Components

### 1. **Simulation Engine** (`src/visualization.py`)

- **Core Features**:
  - Cellular automata grid to simulate ecosystems.
  - Models species interactions, environmental conditions, recovery, and growth mechanisms.
- **Visualization**:
  - Real-time ecosystem state visualization.
  - Displays relationships between environmental and species parameters.

### 2. **Invasion Theories** (`src/invasion_theories.py`)

- Implements key hypotheses to model invasion dynamics:
  - **Enemy Release Hypothesis**
  - **Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability**
  - **Novel Weapons Hypothesis**
  - **Empty Niche Hypothesis**
- Customizable parameters for each model.
