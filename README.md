# An LLM-based multi-agent framework that turns research paper into interactiveÂ games

## Overview

This project models ecosystem dynamics in real-time, simulating interactions among native, invasive, and endangered species. By combining cellular automata, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), and environmental parameter modeling, it provides an interactive platform for understanding species invasion and ecological balance. The goal is to interpret research papers and turn them into interactive games, making it easier for researchers and educators to explore and analyze ecosystem dynamics.
